                    <p>Aside from my education and work i have a lot of hobbies. Over the 18 years i have always loved
                        drawing
                        and i
                        dont think that is stopping anytime soon! I usually draw traditionally but since 2020 i have
                        started
                        enjoying digital work.</p>
                    <p>Since 2021 i have also picked a new instrument, my first one actually. I remember watching an
                        anime
                        where
                        the main character played piano and ever since then i never stopped wanting to play piano or
                        just
                        instruments in general. After that i fell in love with my second instrument: the guitar. I
                        remember
                        not
                        knowing which instrument i wanted more since i could only pick one: Guitar vs Piano. I guess i
                        thought
                        piano would be easier which turned out to be correct. After my first acoustic guitar i finally
                        got
                        my
                        electric. Im hoping to get a bass soon.</p>
